The project is a dynamic **React** dashboard application with state management handled using **Redux**. The dashboard allows users to manage categories and widgets within those categories, supporting features such as:

- **Widget Management**: Users can add, edit, and delete widgets in different categories. The widget panel allows for widget customization with details such as name, description, and image.
  
- **Modal for Widget Editing**: Users can edit widget details through a modal interface, making it easy to modify widget attributes in real time.

- **Search Functionality**: A search input is included to filter widgets based on their names, improving usability.

- **Category Selection**: Users can switch between categories to view and manage the widgets within each category.

- **Add and Remove Widgets**: Users can add new widgets to a category and remove existing ones. An intuitive interface with buttons allows for quick management actions.

- **Overlay Widget Panel**: When adding widgets, an overlay panel appears to guide users through the widget creation process, including specifying the widget's name, description, and image.

- **Widget Deletion & Editing**: Each widget comes with edit and delete functionality, giving users control over widget content.

The project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling, ensuring a minimalistic and responsive design, and **React Icons** for intuitive user interaction.
